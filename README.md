## ü§î FAQs

### ‚ùì I am seeing error like: ‚ÄúFileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'build/115/chromedriver.exe‚Äù when running ‚Äúpython main.py‚Äù

This is a Temporary Bug due which occurs in Chrome 115 due to `chromedriver-autoinstaller`  dependency. The fix is to:

1. Go to [https://googlechromelabs.github.io/chrome-for-testing/#stable](https://googlechromelabs.github.io/chrome-for-testing/#stable) and download "chrome driver" based on your chrome version. (Most likely 115)
2. Extract the zip file
3. Place the "chromedriver" file (or "chromedriver.exe" if you are using Windows) directly into the build/ folder. Make sure you're not placing the extracted folder but only the chrome driver file itself.

4. Run `python main.py` and program should run successfully.

### ‚ùì The scraper is only retrieving 5 results. How can I scrape all Google Maps search results?
A: Open the file `src/config.py` and comment out the line that sets the `max_results` parameter. 

By doing so, you can scrape all the search results from Google Maps. For example, to scrape all restaurants in Delhi, modify the code as follows:
```python
queries = [
    {
        "keyword": "restaurants in delhi",
        # "max_results" : 5,
    },
]
```

### ‚ùì I want to scrape search results for a specific business in a particular location. How can I achieve that?
A: Open the file `src/config.py` and update the `keyword` with your desired search query. 

For example, if you want to scrape data about stupas in Kathmandu üá≥üáµ, modify the code as follows:
```python
queries = [
    {
        "keyword": "stupas in kathmandu",
    },
]
```


### ‚ùì How can I filter google map search results?

A: You have the option to apply filters to your Google Maps search results using the following parameters:

1. min_rating
2. min_reviews
3. max_reviews


To specify filters, open `src/config.py` and specify your filters. 

The Following example will scrape only those listings with a minimum of 5 reviews, and a maximum of 100 reviews

```python
queries = [
    {
        "keyword": "restaurants in delhi",
        "min_reviews": 5 ,
        "max_reviews": 100,
    },
]
```

### ‚ùì Can I scrape more than one query using this script?
A: Absolutely! Open `src/config.py` and add as many queries as you like. 

For example, if you want to scrape restaurants in both Delhi üòé and Bangalore üë®‚Äçüíª, use the following code:
```python
queries = [
    {
        "keyword": "restaurants in delhi",
    },
    {
        "keyword": "restaurants in bangalore",
    }
]
```

### ‚ùì How to Scrape Additional Information like Website, Phone, Working Hours, Booking Appointment Link, Price Range?

We offer a Pro Version of our Google Maps Scraper that enables you to scrape more data points like working hours, booking appointment links, and price range for the scraped locations. Getting information like Working Hours, Booking Appointment Link and Prices Range greatly assists in Prospecting.

Below is an example of the sample lead scraped by Pro Version:
